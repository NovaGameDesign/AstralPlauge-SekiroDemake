Astral Plague is a project created by Cole Andrews, Josh Cary, Trinity Kemper, Herbert Duarte, and Crosley Brady. 

This project was made for our Digital Media and Interaction class in Spring 2024 at Kennesaw State University. 

•	Cole Andrews was the team lead responsible for all core gameplay programming and game design. If something broke it was my fault! 

•	Josh Cary was the Character artist and animator, responsible for all character animations and effects. Josh worked closely with Cole on the player to design the player’s core attacks. 

•	Trinity Kemper was the Enemy Designer and animator responsible for all enemy designs and animations. Trinity worked closely with Cole on all the enemy’s animations and attacks, ensuring timing and visual clarity were executed properly. 

•	Herbert Duarte was the Environment artist responsible for all game backgrounds, foliage, and tile maps. 

•	Crosley Brady did supplementary coding, primarily working on the game start screen and rebinding.
